Practices within this simple project :

What Itâ€™s actually interesting about this project its not complexity but its simplicity. With HTML cloudflare icones has been linked div and li On the CSS side I did linked all class on seperate css page for the purpose of separation of concerns. Please the actual source code because with this project you would be overwhilmed with the simplicity of this project.

GoodLuck !
